Facing the demand for engineers with such skills, Azapa Engineering is really a new type of technical group that supports the entire production process of customers, from planning, software development to deployment.

282,MenuCoster,IT Product,Food & Beverage,1-50 employees,Australia,Monday - Friday,No OT,"Join the Team That Revolutionized Recipe Tech – and Is Doing It Again
About US
Back in 2004, we changed the game. What started as a bold idea—an app that let chefs cost recipes and see nutrition data in minutes—became a first-of-its-kind tool in the food service industry. We were SaaS before it was cool. Our product helped thousands of chefs make faster, smarter, and healthier decisions—and it’s only gotten better.
Fast forward 20 years (time flies when you’re innovating!). Today, MenuWise is on a new mission: to take our platform global with cutting-edge technology that makes things even easier, faster, and more powerful for our users. The chefs still love us, and we’re building something they’ve never seen before.
 Who We Are
We’re a tight-knit remote team of 11 based in Vietnam and the Philippines, and we’re obsessed with building tech that truly helps people. We use agile methodology, and we’re currently working on the most exciting version of MenuWise yet.
 What We Value
We’re not just building software—we’re building a culture of innovation, respect, and fun:
Keep it simple. We strip out jargon and make things make sense.
Work smart. Efficiency and creativity beat grinding any day.
Balance matters. Local working hours and personal time are non-negotiable.
Celebrate often. Big or small, we recognize every win.
Team first. Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do.
Innovate boldly. We love a clever solution.
Delight users. Good UX is great—but great UX surprises and delights.
Communicate clearly. It’s how we stay in sync and move fast.
 Why Join Us?
If you’re looking to be part of a team that values people, creativity, and real impact, MenuWise could be the perfect place for you. We’re small enough for your voice to be heard and ambitious enough to take on the world.
 You’ll have real influence over a product used by professionals every day. Your ideas will shape the future of a platform that’s respected and relied on—and you’ll do it all in a supportive, flexible, and forward-thinking environment.","Our stacks

Đặc thù của https://curama.jp là số lượng các loại dịch vụ tương đối nhiều, mỗi loại dịch vụ sẽ đi kèm với quy tắc tính phí hay thích hợp với giao diện tìm kiếm khác nhau, theo đó việc phát triển hệ thống làm sao để phù hợp với từng dịch vụ trở thành vấn đề cấp thiết. Vì vậy, chúng tôi đang cần tìm kiếm rất nhiều những kỹ sư IT có thể đồng hành cùng chúng tôi phát triển những tính năng này.
Bộ phận technology tại Nhật Bản đang có khoảng 13 kỹ sư, nhưng chưa đủ đáp ứng khối lượng công việc này, hơn nữa hiện tại thị trường Nhật đang thiếu hụt nhân lực kỹ sư IT. Với tình hình đó, chúng tôi nhận ra rằng nếu chỉ tập trung ở Nhật Bản thì sẽ khó có thể đẩy nhanh tốc độ phát triển của sản phẩm, và quyết định xây dựng một đội ngũ phát triển mới tại Việt Nam.
Nhờ vào nguồn nhân lực IT dồi dào tại Việt Nam, chúng tôi sẽ thiết kế và phát triển các hạng mục liên quan đến các tính năng mới cũng như cải tiến dịch vụ hiện có, với mục tiêu phát triển hơn nữa sàn thương mại điện tử curama.jp và mở rộng quy mô để đưa công ty tại Việt Nam trở thành chi nhánh quan trọng về công nghệ của công ty mẹ.

Minma Inc is a start -up development and operation of e-commerce floor https://curama.jp providing more than 300 home services such as shipping, photography, glass repair, ... so that users can search, compare and choose the service. The characteristic of https://curama.jp is a relatively large number of services, each type of service will come with a charging rule or suitable for different search interfaces, whereby the development of the system how to suit each service becomes an urgent issue. Therefore, we are looking for a lot of IT engineers who can accompany us to develop these features.
The Technology Department in Japan has about 13 engineers, but not enough to meet this workload, moreover, the Japanese market is lacking in IT engineer manpower. With that situation, we realize that if only concentrated in Japan, it will be difficult to accelerate the growth rate of the product, and decide to build a new development team in Vietnam.
Thanks to the abundant IT human resources in Vietnam, we will design and develop items related to new features as well as improve the existing services, with the goal of further developing Curama.jp e -commerce and expand the scale to make the company in Vietnam an important branch of the mother company's technology.

TECHBASE VIỆT NAM (TBV) được thành lập vào tháng 5/2015 với vốn đầu tư 100% bởi LY CORPORATION - một công ty công nghệ hàng đầu xứ Phù Tang.
""Tên công ty của chúng tôi, Techbase Việt Nam, có nghĩa là “Công nghệ + Nền tảng + Việt Nam”. Tôi chọn cái tên này để bày tỏ mong muốn trở thành công ty phát triển phần mềm với công nghệ xuất sắc ở Việt Nam.
Do đó, mục tiêu của chúng tôi là hoạt động với tư cách là nhà Phát triển và Cung cấp Dịch vụ, hơn là công ty Gia công Phần mềm. Mặc dù khá khó khăn để xây dựng mô hình kinh doanh này ở Việt Nam, do thị trường và người dùng chính của chúng tôi ở Nhật Bản, nhưng với sự phát triển trong những năm qua và dựa vào kinh nghiệm đã có ở đất nước tuyệt vời này, chúng tôi luôn sẵn kế hoạch cho 3 năm tới và sẽ tiếp tục phát triển hơn nữa trong tương lai. Các thành viên của Techbase Việt Nam đều là những người trẻ, năng động và tài năng, vì vậy tôi rất tin tưởng rằng chúng tôi sẽ làm được.
Let's create the Internet’s future together - Hãy cùng nhau tạo ra tương lai của Internet!""

""Our company name, Techbase Vietnam, meaning"" technology + platform + Vietnam. ""I chose this name to express the desire to become a software development company with excellent technology in Vietnam.
Therefore, our goal is to operate as a developer and service provider, rather than software processing companies. Although it is quite difficult to build this business model in Vietnam, due to our main market and user in Japan, with the development over the years and based on the experience that has been in this wonderful country, we are always planned for the next 3 years and will continue to develop further in the future. The members of Techbase Vietnam are all young, dynamic and talented people, so I really believe that we will do it.

","Making Financial Inclusion a Reality using Machine Learning and AI
We are an AI Fintech company specialized in assessing credit profiles of consumers in emerging markets combining pioneering AI with large alternative data sources.

At the core of this initiative has been our strict and unwavering adherence to the norms of consumer data privacy and consumer data rights.

Although this goal is ambitious, we truly believe that by harnessing the power of AI & Big Data we can deliver financial access at an unprecedented scale.

Our mission is to become the global standard for addressing. Street addresses weren’t designed for 2024. They aren’t accurate enough to specify building entrances, and they don’t exist for parks, rural areas and many parts of the world. This makes it hard to find places and causes problems and inefficiencies on a global scale.

That’s why we created what3words. We divided the world into 3m squares and gave each square a unique combination of three words. It’s the easiest way to find and share precise locations.
Over the last year, what3words has been used in 193 countries, and our monthly active users continue to grow at an impressive pace. Our tech is used by emergency services, delivery companies, eCommerce businesses, ride-hailing apps and NGOs, and is integrated into the navigation systems of millions of cars around the world. Our tech

Kotlin

what3words has built a massively scalable, microservices-based architecture, based around Kubernetes on AWS. You’ll be exposed to technologies such as Swift, Kotlin, Android, iOS, Maven, Gradle, Cocoapods, MLKit, CoreML, Vision, Jetpack Compose, UIKit, Wear, Android Auto and other platforms A very clear, global mission
